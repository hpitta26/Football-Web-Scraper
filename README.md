# Project Info

## Web Scraper using Selenium:
- Scraped offside results from html of both Premier League and La Liga's pages.
- Scraper navigates through the webpage, clicking specific buttons (Accept Cookies, and Stats) that reveal data in the html.
- Scrapes are reproducible for any season, and statistic (records offside results vs specific teams, this data is not readily available online).
- Wrote results to CSVs which can be opened and analyzed on excel, google sheets, etc.

## Future
- Will implement scrapers on Bundesliga, Serie a, Ligue 1, Eredivisie, and Liga Portugal websites.
